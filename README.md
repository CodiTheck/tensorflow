TensorFlow is an **open source** Machine Learning library, created by Google,
for developing and running Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications.

Created by the **Google Brain** team in *2011*, as a proprietary system
dedicated to Deep Learning neural networks, TensorFlow was originally called
**DistBelief**. Later, the source code of DistBelief was modified and the tool
became an application-based library. In **2015**, precisely on *November 9*,
it was renamed to **TensorFlow** and Google made it open source. Since then,
it has undergone more than 21,000 changes through communication and went to
version 1.0 in February 2017.
